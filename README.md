# BNF Interactions
A dedicated repository for work I started in [D3.](https://github.com/fergustaylor/D3) A project visualising [BNF Interaction](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/interaction/) data.

It contains all the code to collect your own BNF Interactions data, reconstruct the same graphics, or for you to create your own.

This data is currently collected periodically, with the last update listed on the left-hand corner of any graphics.

The main graphic I've used in ['Build my Graph'](https://fergustaylor.github.io/bnf-interactions/) and ['top 100'](https://fergustaylor.github.io/bnf-interactions/top100/) is based on the work of [Mike Bostock](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock), creator of D3.js and the original graph is shown [here](https://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html). 
You can find a fantastic version of this as an observable notebook [here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/d3-hierarchical-edge-bundling).
This in turn, is a D3.js implementation of [Danny Holten's](http://www.win.tue.nl/~dholten/) hierarchical edge bundling algorithm.
